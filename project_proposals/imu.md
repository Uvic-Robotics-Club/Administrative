# Rover Module: IMU Position and Motion Detection

### Project Lead:
TBA

### Project status:
 - [x] Ready: See the Software Coordinator ([Gregory O'Hagan](https://github.com/Gregory-OHagan)) or Electrical Coordinator (Matthew McCann) if you would like to start this project.
 - [ ] In progress: See the Project Lead for more information.

### Project description:
The purpose of this project is to build code that makes sense of data generated by an
inertial mass unit circuit fabricated by the electrical team.
