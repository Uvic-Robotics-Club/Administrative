# Rover Module: IMU Position and Motion Detection

### Project Lead:
TBA

### Project status:
 - [x] Ready: See the Software Coordinator ([Gregory O'Hagan](https://github.com/Gregory-OHagan)) or Electrical Coordinator (Matthew McCann) if you would like to start this project.
 - [ ] In progress: See the Project Lead for more information.

### Project description:
The purpose of this project is to build a module that makes sense of data generated by an
inertial mass unit (IMU) circuit fabricated by the electrical team.

### Project deliverables:
 * Use I2C to gather data from the IMU breakout board
 * Provide orientation, position and acceleration models
 * Set up the I2C network with multiple IMUs
 * Develop a system model

### Required language:
 * C++

### Key skills:
 * I2C communication
 * Arduino/pi basics
