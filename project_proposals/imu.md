# Rover Module: IMU Position and Motion Detection

### Project Lead:
TBA

### Project status:
 - [x] Ready: See the Software Coordinator ([Gregory O'Hagan](https://github.com/Gregory-OHagan)) or Electrical Coordinator (Matthew McCann) if you would like to start this project.
 - [ ] In progress: See the Project Lead for more information.

### Project description:

The purpose of this project is to build code that makes sense of data generated by an
inertial mass unit circuit fabricated by the electrical team. 
[Datasheet](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/1e/3f/2a/d6/25/eb/48/46/DM00103319.pdf/files/DM00103319.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00103319.pdf)


### Project deliverables:
 * Use I2C to gather data from the IMU breakout board
 * Provide orientation, position and acceleration models
 * Set up the I2C network with multiple IMUs
 * Develop a system model

### Required language:
 * C++ (Arduino)

### Key skills:
 * I2C communication
 * Arduino basics

### Class:
These functions are provided only as a template and can be modified to suit the needs of the program. For where this will fit into the overall system, see the [class diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AtSNCj34-0V2FGU011Uk9NREE/view?usp=sharing).
